The purpose of this program was to demonstrate my ability independent to work independently and quickly - all the necessary skills needed to excel in a remote environment.

The Redis caching layer in this project was the Amazon ElastiCache for Redis, a fully managed in-memory data store provided by AWS. The Redis cluster is deployed within the same VPC as the EC2 instance hosting the Node.js application. To allow access between services, the ElastiCache Redis security group is configured to accept inbound traffic on port 6379 from the EC2 instance's security group. In the Node.js app, a Redis client connects to the Redis cluster using the clusterâ€™s primary endpoint. Now, my API setup allows the application to cache frequently requested data, such as user records, directly in Redis. By checking the Redis cache before querying the MySQL database, the app reduces load on the database and significantly improves response times for repeated requests.
